## What this is

This is the codebase that contains all of my main legal documents for my projects.
It contains multiple licenses (GNU Public Licenses and Creative Common Licenses to be specific), multiple terms conditions, policies, and more.

All documents are to be used only for the purpose of specifying agreements and policies within codebases and project derivatives.
